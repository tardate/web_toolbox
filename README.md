# Web Toolbox

A collection of utilities and calculators related to stuff I'm interested in.

This is work in progress - first up, collating bits I had scattered on separate sites to here.

## Hosting

I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to run the site. It deploys directly from the GitHub repository.

## Developing

To watch, compile and test coffeescript..

    npm install
    grunt watch

Run locally with Sinatra/WEBrick:

    bundle install
    ruby app.rb
